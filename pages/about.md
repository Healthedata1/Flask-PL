**This is a simple python Flask App FHIR Facade which:**

- [ ] use same Flask app framework as notifications
    - [ ] set up pages
        - [ ] home, contacts etc
        - [ ] steps 1,2,3
        - [ ] display
        - [ ] TODO validate
    - [ ] update figures etc
- [ ] TODO use HealthSamuri/YAML/Markdown
- [ ] set up test data using notifications data set
    - [ ] create Groups from data - using managing entity and provider characteristic to start
    - [ ] start on Hap
- [ ] since server's won't support support custom SP or QM extensions
    - [ ] need to simulate using this as facade
    - [ ] TODO use GRAPHQL if supported else
    - [ ] create sample Q and generate QA from them
        - [ ] TODO figure out how - SDC extensions?
