30-40 User facing lists

in Summary - quantity is present look into

number is dynamic does this make sense too much work - since is 0 to 1... may be hard
to calculate.

useful as convienence - only active patients being returned.
same ln array?  useful in summary but issue on server knowing ahead of time will have to
fetch list to know....

Will the server return only active members?  Some case where list is only active?

Client can filter based on this?
Can Server modify existing list based on client request?
 revisit

char codes -- chagne to location, org, pract, team
so can search on code...

multiple queries better for servers  vs one large queries...

issues when list get too big ...

better to bundle per row per table.

list too large with an error 413 saying too large if unable to process..

Question:

can list patient + encounter

instead of searching  use q = form or simple direct extensions on member
